This directory contains source code for the OpenDDS Monitor library.
This library, when linked and enabled, causes applications to publish
instrumentation data that supplement the Built-In-Topics defined by
the OMG.  The current implementation is intended as a general
mechanism and future versions of OpenDDS will define and publish
additional information.

By default, OpenDDS will not publish monitoring data.  To enable
monitoring, each application process must link with the monitoring
library (OpenDDS_monitor) and initialize the monitor factory.
When using dynamic libraries, this can be done using the
DCPSMonitor option from the command line or configuration file.
When using static libraries, you will also need to include the
dds/monitor/MonitorFactoryImpl.h header to force the monitor
library to be linked.

See the code in $DDS_ROOT/tests/DCPS/Monitor for examples of
publisher and subscriber processes that enable monitoring.

Once monitoring is enabled, OpenDDS applications work as before
but now publish samples over several monitor topics as certain
entities are created, modified, or destroyed.  In later
releases there will also be some periodic samples published
containing metrics.  The data types and topic names supported
are defined in $DDS_ROOT/dds/monitor/monitor.idl.  All of these
topics are located in the OpenDDS::DCPS::MONITOR_DOMAIN_ID domain.
Applications subscribe to these topics like any other DDS topic.
The example in $DDS_ROOT/tests/DCPS/Monitor also contains a monitor
executable that subscribes to each of these topics.  See the code
there for details on how to subscribe to and process these samples.

There is also a graphical monitor application in
$DDS_ROOT/tools/monitor.

Note: The periodic monitor topics are not currently supported.
