OpenDDS_UML_sketches.asta
consists of UML sketches (a few class diagrams and a number of
sequence diagrams) to aid in understanding the architecture of
OpenDDS. The modeling elements are not necessarily complete (e.g. all
operations may not be shown for a class) or precise (e.g. the return
type for many operations in the model is specified as void although
DDS::ReturnCode_t is used in actual OpenDDS code for these
operations). This file can be opened for viewing and editing using the
community edition of Astah available from http://astah.net/.
