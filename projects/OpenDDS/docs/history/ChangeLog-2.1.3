Thu Jun 17 19:59:05 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Process.cpp:

          Extended the sub timeout on waiting for pub termination.

        * NEWS:

          Added changes after last release.

Thu Jun 17 19:50:31 UTC 2010  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:

          Increased RECEIVED_BUFFERS from 2 to 16 and BUFFER_LOW_WATER from 1500 to 4096.
          This is to better insure that the total available space in the receive buffers
          can hold the max size message (64K).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Changed receive_bytes error from debug message to warning message because some
          errors may be non-recoverable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Changed OUTCOME_SEND_ERROR from debug message to warning message because some
          errors may be non-recoverable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

           Removed unused method name parameter from ACE_ERROR usages
           (not needed as method is described in error messages).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Changed send_naks() to do nothing if the session hasn't been acknowledged.

          Changed nak_received() to send nakack only if the send buffer no longer has
          the lowest sequence number requested.

Thu Jun 17 19:47:17 UTC 2010  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

         * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Avoid OpenDDS failures because of interupts while in system calls.

Thu Jun 17 19:44:59 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:

          Added OpenDDS-Bench entry for point release.

Thu Jun 17 15:51:26 UTC 2010  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Corrected constructor of SequenceNumber to modulo by SHRT_MAX + 1 as SHRT_MAX is a valid SequenceNumber.

Thu Jun 17 15:41:41 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed a typo in command-line argument processing.  Thanks to Shawn
          Mitchell <shawn dot mitchell at Q1Labs dot com> for reporting it.

Wed Jun 16 06:25:37 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkWatchdog_T.h:

          Fixed threading issue for internal state setting which causes
          access violation during shutdown.

Tue Jun 15 19:35:29 UTC 2010  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

          Removed support for IP_MULTICAST_LOOP as it isn't supported by TAO 1.5 and it
          isn't a required feature for OpenDDS multicast.

Tue Jun 15 17:01:42 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkWatchdog_T.h:

          Fixed a warning.

Tue Jun 15 16:52:06 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkWatchdog_T.h:

          Fixed a deadlock situation during shutdown. One thread calls
          the timer cancellation while the reactor thread handling timeout.
          The DataLinkWatchdog internal lock and reactor lock are acquired
          reversely. Added reverse lock to solve the issue.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          - Set send_naks_ flag based on active/passive role of the session
            instead of setting upon send_syn() call and not schedule nak timer
            if session is for pub.
          - Added debug outpt to help detect lost message.

        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastTransport.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Added missing include.

Mon Jun 14 06:28:29 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

          Corrected session_lock_ scope in sample_received()
          missed in last commit.

Mon Jun 14 04:26:23 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          - Resolved a deadlock situation due to reverse locking during
            pub and sub association.
            One thread calls add_associations which acquires TransportImpl
            reservation_lock_ and then MulticastDataLink session_lock_.
            The reactor thread handle the control message which acquires
            MulticastDataLink session_lock_ and then TransportImpl
            reservation_lock_ due to check_fully_association() call to
            TransportImpl. To solve the deadlock, the check_fully_association()
            is called outside of session_lock_ locking.

          - Updated to send one nak message per DisjointSequence with all ranges
            instead of one per each range. This would reduce nak message overflow.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/DataReaderListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/publisher.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/run_test-16p4s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/MulticastListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added test result verify using DisjointSequence and added 16p4s test
          script.

Sat Jun 12 15:21:00 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendBuffer.inl:

          Added ACE_INLINE qualifier.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:

          Changed an empty #elif to #else to avoid a compilation
          complaint.

Fri Jun 11 12:27:24 UTC 2010  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Moved deletion of writer association info within check that iterator isn't at end.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Added removal of pending associations when removing all.

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Corrected <operator.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.inl:

          Corrected DisjointSequence::range_iterator when there is no gap between two elements in the sequence.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Corrected shifting of low water mark.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Added nil check before using listener.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added debug warning to ack_received() for publication not found as the ack may be for
          another link (ack for a publication that doesn't have a listener is still an error.)

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Added scope around guard in OpenDDS::DCPS::TransportImpl::demarshal_acks(ACE_Message_Block* acks, bool byte_order)
          and added guard to void OpenDDS::DCPS::TransportImpl::check_fully_association() so guard isn't skipped when
          check_fully_association() is called from ReliableSession::synack_received().

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.cpp:

          Correcting cloning of messages that have continuation blocks

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Corrected computation of pdu_remaining to use buffer->length() instead of buffer->space().

          Added checking of sample header and skipping of samples that fail the check.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendBuffer.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendBuffer.inl:

          Added empty().

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/BestEffortSession.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/BestEffortSession.cpp:

          Changed header_received(const TransportHeader& header) to check_header(const TransportHeader& header)
          which better reflects its purpose.

          Added virtual bool check_header(const DataSampleHeader& header) that returns true
          with comment as to why it returns true (this mirrors existing method check_header(const TransportHeader& header)).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

          Added support for configuring the socket receive buffer size by transport through new configuration option: rcv_buffer_size.
          Increasing the receive buffer size can reduce dropped samples (which contribute to the nak storms), especially
          in a many-to-one multi-cast topology.

       * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

          Added support for configuring multicast loop back through use of ACE option -ORBIPMulticastLoop.
          When multicast loop back is on (by default), everything in the send buffer is copied to the recieve buffer.
          Multicast loop back can be turned off when producers are on separate machines from subscribers; this can improve performance.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.h:

          Changed header_received(const TransportHeader& header) to check_header(const TransportHeader& header)
          which better reflects its purpose.

          Added bool MulticastDataLink::check_header(const DataSampleHeader& header).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:

          Changed to Skip a data sample unless there is a session for it (control samples aren't skipped).

          Reset rd_ptr of control message when looping through sessions.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastReceiveStrategy.h:

          Added virtual bool check_header(const DataSampleHeader& header).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Changed to skip samples that were sent by itself.

          Changed to skip samples that have already been processed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastSession.h:

          Changed header_received(const TransportHeader& header) to check_header(const TransportHeader& header)
          which better reflects its purpose.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Recorded control messages in header received list even if the session hasn't been acknowedged.

          Added additional filtering out of control messages that aren't to the session.

          Added additional nakacks to reduce naks from remotes.

          Limited nakack warning messages to DCPS_debug_level 0 and made warning message more generic.

          Disabled sending naks from producers and receiving naks by subscribers since only producers
          send data samples, control samples don't need to be resent, and implementation doesn't
          support a session being both a producer and subscriber.

          Changed header_received(const TransportHeader& header) to check_header(const TransportHeader& header)
          which better reflects its purpose.

        * performance-tests/Bench/etc/transport-multi-rel.ini:

          Tweaked configuration of reliable multicast transports to reduce nak storms.

          Added remove association before shutting down tests that don't go through the normal shutdown steps.
          This stops warning from ~DataLink() that link is still in use.

Tue Jun  1 21:40:48 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/RcHandle_T.h:

          The operator=(T* p) needs remove reference from current
          handle if it's same object as provided, otherwise, the
          object will be leaked. This fixed RepoIdSet and
          ReceiveListenerSet leaks.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Fixed association info leak.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed leaks due to get_type_name() not assigned to String_var.

Fri May 28 16:29:14 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * java/build_scripts/jni_check.pl:

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/im_java.cpp:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/im_jni.cpp:

          Handle AST_Decl::NT_interface_fwd (forward declarations) as if they
          were full declarations.  I don't think we should be seeing these,
          but something has changed in the TAO_IDL_FE.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-test-results.sh:
        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-throughput-transports.gp:

          Corrected graph mapping and changed to graph with simple lines by
          default and try to graph with smooth on a second pass to ensure
          that graphs are drawn even when one set of data is missing.

          Reverted changes made in last commit and added comments
          for dropped_by_transport flag used. These changes in last
          commit do not affect the duplicate message issue.

Fri May  7 01:40:13 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.inl:

          Fixed a bug that incorrectly callback
          data_dropped(dropped_by_transport=false) when one link
          drops sample and other links deliver successfully. It was
          corrected to call data_dropped(true). This fixed duplicate
          message issue caused by a lost link.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:

          was processed.  Added in missing test run information.

Wed May  5 17:14:34 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Moved the publisher->remove_associations call out of DataWriter
          locking scope to fix a deadlock issue due to reverse locking with
          DataWriter lock and TransportImpl lock when remove/add associations
          are handled concurrently.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added locking for pub_map_.release_subscriber to make pub_map_
          update synchronized. This is a potential cause for a SEGV due
          to ReceiveListenerSet destructed during remove_associations.

Tue May 04 23:31:01 UTC 2010  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/run_test.pl:

          Adjusted so the run_test.pl timeout is longer than the run_test
          timeout.  This should stop stranding testprocesses waiting on the
          multicast transports.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/extract-latency.pl:

          Updated documentation to be correct after adding the Median and
          Median absolute deviation statistical data.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/gen-latency-stats.pl:

          Updated generated GNUPlot statistical legend data to contain
          the Median and Median absolute deviation instead of the Mean
          and Standard Deviation.  This is part of the move towards use
          of robust statistics in the data reduction and visualization.

          estimation of skewness for investigative purposes.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

        * performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html:

          Incorporated some more of Brian's comments.  Updated run_test
          man page with new statistics output filename decorator
          specification feature documentation.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Process.cpp:

          Extended signal handling to be a bit more robust.  Control can
          now fall out of the publication wait as well as allowing the
          subscription wait to be gracefully terminated as well.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendBuffer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          - Made TransportSendBuffer clone the transport element and
            packet with its own MessageBlock and DataBlock cached
            allocators and heap allocation for the sample data.

          - Fixed a potential issue in TransportSendBuffer due to buffers_
            not mutex protected. The bug may cause invalid iterator(or
            corruption) while iterating sequence buffers for resending
            from reactor thread and the insert calls to release aged
            buffer due to capacity limit from another thread (e.g. write
            thread).

          - Changed TransportQueueElement::data_dropped and
            TransportQueueElement::data_delivered to have return value
            to indicate if the element is released. This would fix
            memory corruption due to access the release flag after
            TransportQueueElement is released.

          - Moved clone() from TransportReplacedElement to
            TransportQueueElement so the TransportRetainElement
            can use it.

          Adjusted to have the run_test on the server side handle the repo.
          Running the repo as a separate run_test was leaving cases of the repo
          still running after terminating the run_test.
