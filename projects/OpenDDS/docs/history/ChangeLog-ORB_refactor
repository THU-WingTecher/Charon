        * Merged from trunk r3399 r5647 through r5669.

Fri Jun  8 19:29:36 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp:

          Fix decrement operation in dtor so ORB will shut down
          properly.

Fri Jun  8 14:48:20 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp:

          Don't create an ORB in internal remote object functions.
          Instead pass IRD's ORB.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Moved initialization of reactor_ from
          timer() to ctor.

Wed Jun  6 21:43:48 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Handle -ORBLogFile and -ORBVerboseLogging internally
          instead of passing off to ORB_init() so that these
          options can be used if an ORB isn't being used.

        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Moved function templates remote_reference_to_servant(),
          servant_to_remote_reference(), deactivate_remote_object()
          from Service_Participant.h to InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp.

Tue Jun  5 16:04:37 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/pubsub.cpp:

          Avoid use of raw pointer introduced in previous
          commit.

Tue Jun  5 15:16:40 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/ConfigFile/ConfigFile.cpp:

          Removed uneeded code that was causing compile error.

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/pubsub.cpp:

          Moved setting of ORB from ServiceParticipant to
          InfoRepoDiscovery.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/README:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/run_test.pl:

          Removed option to have client set the ORB, which
          wasn't being used.

        * Merged r5637 through r5646 from trunk.

Mon Jun  4 16:33:14 UTC 2012  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * Merged r5511 through r5636 from trunk. Note there are still
          compile errors because Service_Participant no longer has
          member functions set_ORB() and the_POA().

Fri Apr 13 22:40:31 UTC 2012  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Service_Participant no longer manages the ORB and the POA.
          There is a new API "timer()" to get the ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface
          which can be used for scheduling timers but not for Reactor I/O.

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Adapted to the modified Service_Participant API.

        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.h:

          InfoRepoDiscovery is now responsible for the ORB and the POA.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a Reactor managed by the RtpsDiscovery object.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepoServ.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          The ORB is now managed by the InfoRepoDiscovery objet.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTest/publisher.cpp:

          Replaced TheServiceParticipant->get_ORB()
          with the new timer() accessor.
