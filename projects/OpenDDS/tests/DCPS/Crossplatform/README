This directory contains crossplatform test scripts. There
 are no test executables here, instead the regular
 executables are used to run the test across the network.

The test framework is implemented in $DDS_ROOT/bin/PerlDDS/Cross_Sync*.pm

The cross platform testing schedule is maintained in test_list.txt.
 Every test has three configuration components. The test group, the
 server and client machine names. The test group has no relevance
 outside the nightly test environment. It identifies a specific
 instance of the nightly build during which the test should be run.
 Any two nightly builds defined as part of a single group need to set
 the environment variable CROSS_GRP to the value defined here.

Messenger_run_test.pl: Based upon the $DDS_ROOT/tests/DCPS
 /Messenger/run_corbaloc_test.pl test.
