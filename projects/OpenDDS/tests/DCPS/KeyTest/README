This directory contains unit tests for some of the key-related
functionality of OpenDDS.  The file KeyTest.idl contains a number
of DCPS data type definitions and corresponding key definitions
that Open DDS should allow (and produce valid code for).  The
files of the form KeyTypeError_*.idl each contain what should
be flagged as an illegal key definition from OpenDDS' perspective.

KeyMarhalling.cpp uses some of the data types and keys from KeyTest.idl
to do some run-time testing of the key marshaling functionality.

run_test.pl will run the KeyMarshaling executable and verify the
errors in the various KeyTypeError_*.idl files.
