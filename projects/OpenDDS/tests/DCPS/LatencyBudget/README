This test confirms that LATENCY_BUDGET support in OpenDDS functions
according to the OMG DDS specification.  This test has two modes of
operation:

1) Without any arguments, it operates with the DataReader's latency
budget QoS set to 1 second and the writer setting the timestamp on
outgoing messages to the current time.

2) With the "late" argument to run_test.pl, the DataReader's latency
budget QoS remains set to 1 second, but the writer sets the timestamp back
10 seconds on outgoing messages. The test's expectation is that the reader
will receive 10 callbacks indicating that the budget has been exceeded.
