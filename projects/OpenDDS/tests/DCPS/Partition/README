This test verifies the PARTITION QoS support in OpenDDS.  It does so
by creating publishers that offer a number of partitions.  Only
subscribers with matching requested partitions will be associated with
the given publisher.

Publisher Partitions
====================
A number of publishers with the following partition lists will be
created:

Partition Contents      Description
--------- --------      -----------
1         ""            Explicitly created sequence of length one
                        containing an empty string.

2         Loner         Should not match since it will not be requested.

3         Amadeus       Will be matched by two different subscribers.
          Ziggie*dust

4         Wun?Two[0-9][!a-z]Tree  Will be matched by one subscribed.

5         Not*A Match   Should not match, by design, since the closest
                        matching requested partition will also contain
                        a wildcard.


Subscriber Partitions
=====================
A number of subscriber with the following partition lists will be
created:

Partition Contents        Description
--------- --------        -----------
1         Zero length     Should match the empty string "" partition,
          sequence        offered partition 1.

2         Amadeus         Should match offered partitions 3 and 4,
          Wun1Two23Tree   i.e. an exact match and a wildcard match.


3         ZiggieStardust  Should match offered (wildcard) partition 3.


4         Not?A*Match     Should not match partition 5, or any other
                          partition, since the both the offered and
                          requested partition will by design contain a
                          wildcard.

Summary of Expected Results
===========================
1. Requested partition 1 should match offered partition 1.
2. Requested partition 2 should match offered partitions 3 and 4.
3. Requested partition 3 should match offered partition 3.
4. Requested partition 4 should not be matched.
4. Offered partition 2 should not be matched.
5. Offered partition 5 should not be matched.
