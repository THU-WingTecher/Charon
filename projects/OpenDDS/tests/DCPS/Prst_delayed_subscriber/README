Simple test to test InfoRepo persistance mechanism. The
publisher expects two subscribers. The test driver starts up the
InfoRepo and the first subscriber. After the subscriber dies the
driver kills the InfoRepo and reincarnates it. It then starts up
the second subscriber. The test will succeed only if InfoRepo is
running with persistence turned on.
