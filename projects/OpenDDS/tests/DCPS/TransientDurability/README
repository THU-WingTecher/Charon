The TRANSIENT kind of the DURABILITY QoS policy configures the
publisher within a given domain to retain unsent data beyond the
lifetime of its DataWriters so that subsequently created DataWriters
within that publisher will have the opportunity to send the unsent
data.  The "durable" unsent data will not outlive the publisher.

This test verifies properly functioning TRANSIENT DURABILITY support
in OpenDDS by performing the following actions:

1. Write data for a specific domain/topic/type through a DataWriter
   that has not been associated with a DataReader.  (No pub/sub match
   yet).
2. Allow that DataWriter to go out of scope.
3. Create a new DataWriter for the same domain/topic/type.  New data
   will not be written to this DataWriter.  Cached "durable" data
   should instead be retrieved from the underlying data durability
   cache.
4. A subscription to this domain/topic/type will then occur, after
   which the data that was in the durability cache will be sent to the
   DataReader.
5. To test "service_cleanup_delay", a new DataWriter for a dummy topic
   will be created with the appropriate QoS settings.
