# This configuration file keeps the InfoRepo from processing incomming calls
# while calling RemoteDataReader/Writers (outgoing calls) so it will not
# have too worry about subscription and publication objects being deleted
# while in the middle of an operation.
#
# The purpose of these configuration options is to stop the ORB from using an application
# thread that is making an outgoing CORBA call from processing incomming CORBA calls while
# waiting for a response to the outgoing call.
# This may be necessary to avoid race conditions or deadlocking in the application code.
# Using this configuration may induce network deadlock when an applicaiton uses its thread(s)
# to make outgoing calls and the processing of those calls expects to make a CORBA call
# back to the application but it will not process the call because the thread(s) are
# bussy waiting for a response (without processing incomming calls).
