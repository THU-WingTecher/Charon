The directory containing this README is only needed to develop the
OpenDDS SDK, an Eclipse plug-in that allows the elements used in an
OpenDDS system to be modeled diagrammatically.

For obtaining and installing the plug-in for capturing models and
generating C++ code, use the software site at:

  http://www.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse_44

Add this site to your Eclipse installation by:

  select the preferences dialog from the main menu:
    Window->Preferences

  select the software site page:
    "Install/Update"->"Available Software Sites"

  open the "Add Site" dialog:
    "Add..."

  enter the name and location:
    Name:     OpenDDS
    Location: http://www.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse_44

  accept the result:
    "Ok"

  check the site:
    "Test Connection"


Make sure the core Eclipse sites are enabled.  These may be disabled in
shared installations (for example, if Eclipse was installed by a Linux
distribution's software repository).  Using Eclipse 4.4 (Galileo), the two
sites to look for are http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.4 and
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna.
With these enabled, Eclipse will be able to install features that the
OpenDDS modeling SDK uses but might not already be available on your system.


Install the OpenDDS SDK Modeling feature by:

  select the software installation dialog:
    Help->"Install New Software..."

  select the new software site:
    "Work with:" - select the "OpenDDS" site from the pull-down list.
    Then hit the <Enter> key.

  select the feature for installation:
    [x] OpenDDS Modeling SDK Feature Bundle

  complete the installation:
    "Next" and follow the remaining installation wizard steps.
