<h1>Model Integration</h1>

<p>When models reference other models, additional configuration is required using the Build Paths tab.</p>

<div class="note">These build paths are used at build time to locate generated model libray code to compile 
and link, not to find model files during code generation.</div>

<h2>Parameters to Build Paths</h2>

<p>Build Paths consist of a series of search paths, used to find other models.</p>

<h3>Search Path Contents</h3>

<p>Each search path consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Base Variable</b> - an environment variable used as the basis for the search path.</li>
<li><b>Path</b> - an additional path, relative to the value of the base variable, to create the path.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each part of the search path can be omitted.  It can consist of a Base variable only, or a search path only.</p>

<h2>Default Search Paths</h2>

<p>The model file can be selected using the Browse button next to the Model File text field.  Navigate to the desired .opendds model file and hit OK.</p>

<p>Additional search paths can be added through an existing search path's context menu, selecting Add Sibling.</p>

<div class="note">Should the last build path be deleted from a model file, use the Outline view, navigate to searchLocations and select Add Child in its context menu.</div>
