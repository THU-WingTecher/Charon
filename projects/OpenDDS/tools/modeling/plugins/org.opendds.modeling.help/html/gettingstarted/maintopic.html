<h1>OpenDDS Modeling SDK</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<img src="../images/opendds.png" align="left" alt="OpenDDS Logo"><a href="http://www.opendds.org/">OpenDDS</a> is an open source C++ 
implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG)
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/dds_spec_catalog.htm">
Data Distribution Service (DDS)</a>.
</p>

<p>The OpenDDS Modeling SDK allows graphical modeling of the OpenDDS components
and automatic conversion of the resulting model to C++ code that can be
accessed by your application.</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

This section lists enhancements and fixes of OpenDDS Modeling SDK, as well as the version
of OpenDDS and the Modeling SDK they correspond to.
NOTE: The OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version went from 1.1.0 to 3.0.0, so that its version will
be consistent with the OpenDDS Version.

<h3>
  OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version 3.6.0 (OpenDDS Version 3.6.0)
</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
      Updated plugin to support Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) and GMF 3.1.x
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>
  OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version 3.0.1 (OpenDDS Version 3.0.1)
</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
      Fixed support for transitive external topic references in the same
      directory.  Previously was erroneously converting the directory name
      to a full path.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>
  OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version 3.0.0 (OpenDDS Version 3.0)
</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
      Support for the OpenDDS transport configuration changes in this
      release (see the OpenDDS NEWS file).  In the .opendds file,
      DcpsLib entities now have an TransportConfig attribute.
      In the .codegen file, the schmea for describing transport
      configuration (on the Model Customization tab) is all new.
        </li>
        <li>
      Added the ability to validate .opendds and .codegen files against
      their corresponding XML schemas.  Use the context menu on those
      files to invoke schema validation.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>
  OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version 1.1.0 (OpenDDS Version 2.4)
</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
      Topic types from a DcpsLib shown in Project Explorer can be
      dragged to diagram for another DcpsLib. This allows the same
      Topic to be used in multiple DcpsLibs.
      NOTE: External multitopics may need types to be registered manually.
        </li>
        <li>
      For QoS policy Periods, symbol "Infinity" can be used for the
      second and nanosecond fields.
        </li>
        <li>
      In the main diagram, when a lib (or package) on the canvas is
      dragged inside a parent package, visual feedback will occur that
      the parent package has a new child. Previously, unless dragging
      to the top portion of the parent, the child was merely moved to
      a new location on the canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
      Added validation warning if Pub/Sub's transportID not explicitly
      set.
        </li>
        <li>
      Fixed so that when removing a Topic or MultiTopic's data type
      reference the Struct referred to by the data type is not also
      removed.
        </li>
        <li>
      Generated IDL now protected from multiple inclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
      Modeling SDK executables no longer require -ORBSvcConfig command line
      arguments to load transport shared libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
      Fixed support for generation of IDL with cycles in its definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
      Fixed "Decorator refresh failure" that occurred when doing
      validation in one sub-diagram that is the same type as another
      another opened sub-diagram (e.g. two PolicyLib diagrams). This
      problem was causing subsequent attempts to validate to fail in
      either sub-diagram.
        </li>
        <li>
      Disabled cut, copy, and paste menu items to prevent model
      corruption that could occur in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>
      Added QoS policy validation checks consistent with checks done
      in OpenDDS C++ code.
        </li>
        <li>
      Fixed so that Ecore packages do no show up multiple times when
      navigating model contents in Project Explorer.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>
  OpenDDS Modeling SDK Version 1.0.1 (OpenDDS Version 2.3)
</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
      The property sheet now includes a tab for viewing and editing
      comments related to the selected figure. These comments are
      included in the generated C++ code.
       </li>
        <li>
      In some cases, when attempting to add a figure to a Package
      on the main diagram, the figure would unknowingly be placed as a
      peer of the Package on the canvas. A fix was made so the figure
      could be added to any portion of the Package to be treated as a
      child of the Package.
       </li>
        <li>
      When creating a new figure, the cursor will now be set on a
      label within the figure to edit. Previously, in some cases
      the cursor would not be placed on any label, increasing the
      chance to overlook defining required properties.
       </li>
        <li>
      Fixed so that when a Topic or MultiTopic's data type is
      changed a refresh of the data type is properly done. Previously
      both the original and new data type may have been displayed.
       </li>
        <li>
      Previously, when deleting a figure that included an association
      with a shared policy, the shared policy would also be deleted.
      Now shared policies will be retained in this case.
       </li>
        <li>
      In the DcpsLib diagram, the special connector tools in
      the palette for linking DataReaders and DataWriters to
      topic related figures are no longer needed and have been
      removed. These links can now be done using connection
      handles as is done for other figures.
       </li>
        <li>
      Fixed diagram preferences all showing up under the DataLib
      preferences, making it hard to set preferences for the
      different diagram types.
       </li>
        <li>
      Policy definitions from the OpenDDS Developer's Guide were
      included in the Eclipse help content to make it easier to
      get to these definitions during modeling.
       </li>
        <li>
      The modeling help content was broken out into subsections to
      make it easier to navigate.
       </li>
        <li>
      On the code generation portion of the OpenDDS Modeling SDK, a
      fix was made so that when creating a new element value in the
      Model Customization tab property sheet, the value shown for the
      element is the actual value and not the value from the previous
      element displayed.
       </li>
    </ul>
