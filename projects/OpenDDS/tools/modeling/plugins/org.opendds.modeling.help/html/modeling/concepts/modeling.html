<p>Graphical modeling Eclipse plug-ins are provided for constructing the OpenDDS models that will be
transformed into C++ code.</p>

<p>The modeling is done in one of the following diagram types:
<ul>
	<li><b>Main Diagram</b> This is the entry point for the modeling and can include "libraries", which are
	reusable packages. The description of the libraries follows.</li>
	<li><b>Policy Library</b> This contains a collection of QoS Policies that typically work together
	to achieve an overall QoS characteristic. For example, one policy library may have policies tuned
	for reliable data transmission, while another library has policies tuned for high-performance
	data transmission.</li>
	<li><b>Data Library</b> This contains the data types used to define the structure of the data
	being published.</li>
	<li><b>DCPS Library</b> This is where topology for the publishing and subscribing entities are defined.
	The elements from the other libraries, such as QoS Policies, and Structs, will be used in this
	library.</li> 
</ul>
