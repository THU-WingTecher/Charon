  <h2>Creating Data Libraries</h2>

  <p>From the main diagram a Data Library can be created by either
  double-clicking on the DataLib tool in the palette, or by
  clicking on the DataLib tool and then dragging the region on the
  diagram surface that the Data library figure should occupy. After
  that specify the name to use for the library.</p>

  <p>The library can then be opened by double-clicking on the
  library. A new diagram editor will be opened (using the same
  diagram file used for the main diagram).</p>
