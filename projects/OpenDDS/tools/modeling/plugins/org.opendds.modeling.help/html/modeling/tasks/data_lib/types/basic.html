  <p>Ultimately, basic types like Long, Octet, or String, must be
  referred to by the other types. When using connectors an option
  is to add these basic types to the diagram and later connect to
  these types. Alternatively, you can quickly create basic types on
  the fly as they are needed using the figure connector handles.
  (You can have multiple figures of the same basic type on the same
  diagram if you wish.)</p>
