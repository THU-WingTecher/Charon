  <img alt="Types with Fields Palette" src="../../../images/datalib_typedef_field_palette.png" align="right">

  <p>Struct and Union have Fields which are named references to
  types (similar to class attributes). To add a Field, click on the
  Field tool in the palette and then click on the Struct or Union
  to contain the Field. You then fill out the Field using the form
  "name: type". For example, to indicate that a Field is to be
  named count and that points to a Long you would enter "count:
  Long". (Basic types do not need to be created first.) The type
  can be from any of the active DataLibs in addition to the types
  in the currently opened diagram.</p>

  <div class="caution">
  <p>If a Field has not been defined properly (for example, a reference
  is made to a type that does not exist) you will see
  &lt;...&gt; in its place. Either edit the field using the
  "name: type" form or delete the field from the Struct.</p>
