  <h2>Working with compartments within compartments</h2>

  <p>As you drill down from a DomainParticipant to the DataReaders
  and DataWriters with QoS policies, there will be numerous
  compartments within compartments. To help maneuver around these,
  you can collapse compartments not of interest at the moment, and
  open compartments that you are interested in. In addition, you
  may want to review <a href=
  "../diagrams/arranging_figures.html">arranging
  figures</a> on how to automatically resize and reposition
  elements in compartments so they don't overlap.</p>
