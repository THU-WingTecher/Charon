  <h2>Creating DCPS Libraries</h2>

  <p>From the main diagram a DCPS Library can be created by either
  double-clicking on the DcpsLib tool in the palette, or by
  clicking on the DcpsLib tool and then dragging the region on the
  diagram surface that the DCPS Library figure should occupy. After
  that specify the name to use for the library.</p>

  <p>The library can then be opened by double-clicking on the
  library. A new diagram editor will be opened (using the same
  diagram file used for the main diagram).</p>
