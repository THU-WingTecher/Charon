  <h2>Creating a DataWriter</h2>

  <p>A DataWriter is added to a Publisher by default when a Publisher
  is created. Additional DataWriters can be created by selecting a DataWriter from the
  palette and adding it to the DataWriter compartment of a
  Publisher. QoS policies can be added to the DataWriter as
  needed.</p><img alt="DataWriter example" src=

  <p>The DataWriter must be connected to a Topic to be semantically complete.
  See <a href="../diagrams/connecting_figures.html">Connecting Figures</a>
  for information on how to connect a DataWriter to a Topic.</p>
