  <h2>Working with QoS Policies</h2>

  <p>Many of the DCPS domain entities can have certain QoS Policies
  associated with them. A policy can be a custom policy unique to
  that entity, or a shared policy defined in a policy library.</p>

  <p>To add a policy to an entity, right-click on the entity to
  bring up the context menu and select "Add QoS Policy". From there
  you can select whether a custom policy should be created or a
  reference to a policy from a library should be used.</p><img alt=
  "Policy menu" src="../../images/dcpslib_policy_menu.png">

  <p>A collapsible compartment is used for custom policies and a
  collapsible compartment is used for shared policies. If you are
  not sure which compartment is which, you can hover your mouse
  over any compartment and the name of the compartment will
  appear.</p>
