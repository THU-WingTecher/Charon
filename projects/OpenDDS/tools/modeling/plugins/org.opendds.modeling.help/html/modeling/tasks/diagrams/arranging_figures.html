  <h2>Arranging Figures</h2>

  <p>Some OpenDDS modeling elements, such as Packages and Domain
  Participants, can have nested compartments of figures. Sometimes
  these compartments can become cluttered as you add figures to
  them, as shown below.</p><img alt="Cluttered compartment" src=
  "../../images/diagram_compartments_cluttered.png">

  <p>The diagram toolbar includes some buttons to automatically
  resize and reposition your figure elements:</p><img alt=
  "Diagram toolbar positioning buttons" src=
  "../../images/diagram_toolbar_positioning_buttons.png">

  <p>The Arrange button will reposition figures so they will not
  overlap. If you select a figure within a compartment and then
  select Arrange All, that figure and the others within the
  compartment will be rearranged.</p>

  <p>The Auto Size button will expand a parent figure as needed to
  accommodate its children. Auto Size will also shrink a figure if
  it has unused space.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>If you manually resize a figure with compartments,
    collapsing a compartment will not result in a figure being
    reduced in size as you might expect. Select the figure and then
    enable Auto Size to have the figure shrink too.</p>
  </div>

  <p>After issuing Auto Size and Arrange All a few times you can
  un-clutter your compartments:</p><img alt=
