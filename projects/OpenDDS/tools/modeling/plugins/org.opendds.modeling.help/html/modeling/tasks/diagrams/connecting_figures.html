  <h2>Connecting Figures</h2>

  <p>For figures that are intended to be connected to each other,
  connection creation assistants can be used. When hovering your
  mouse over a figure to be connected, connection handlers will
  appear as shown below.</p><img alt="Connection handles" src=

  <p>If both the source and target figures already exist on the
  diagram, you can directly connect them in one of two ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the selected figure is to be the connection
    <i>source</i>, you can then connect to a target figure by
    clicking on the box on the outgoing arrow and dragging to the
    target.</li>

    <li>If the selected figure is to be the connection
    <i>target</i>, you can click on the box on the incoming arrow
    and drag to the source figure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An alternative way to make connections is as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the selected figure is to be the <i>source</i> figure,
    click on the box connected to the connection handle's outgoing
    arrow and drag to empty portion of the canvas. You will then be
    prompted to create allowed target figures, or to select from
    existing figures on the diagram.</li>

    <li>If the selected figure is to be the <i>target</i> figure,
    click on the box connected to the connection handle's incoming
    arrow and drag to empty portion of the canvas. You will then be
    prompted to create allowed source figures,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An example connection menu for source figure is shown
  below.</p><img alt="Source's target menu" src=
  "../../images/diagram_connection_sources_target_menu.png">

  <div class="note">
    <p>As you may have discovered by now, you can also create a
    connection to a Note figure. While this is a great way to help
    document your model, keep in mind that notes are associated
    with the diagram only and are not part of the domain model
    itself.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Once connected, the target figure will have the arrow
  connected to it. An example connection is shown
  below.</p><img alt="Connected figures" src=
