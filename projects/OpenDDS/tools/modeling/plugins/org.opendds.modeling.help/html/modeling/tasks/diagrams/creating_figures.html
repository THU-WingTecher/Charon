  <h2>Creating Figures</h2>

  <p>Figures can be added to the canvas in one of three ways:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>Clicking on the figure type from the palette, and then
  	holding down on the mouse while dragging a figure corner on the canvas to specify the size of
  	the figure.</li>
  	<li>Double click on the figure type from the palette.</li>
  	<li>Click on a figure type from the palette and then click somewhere on the canvas.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note">
  <p>A disadvantage of the first method is that if the figure has compartments and content is added to a compartment,
  then the figure will not be extended after the content is added. This means that,
  depending on the size of the figure, the compartment content may not be
  visible until the parent figure is expanded. Using the second and third methods have the advantage of
  automatic figure re-sizing to accommodate sub-figures being added.</p>
