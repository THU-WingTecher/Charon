  <h2>Moving between diagrams</h2>

  <p>In the course of working with the various libraries in an
  OpenDDS model, you may find yourself with numerous diagram edit
  windows open. To make it easy to move back and forth between these
  windows you can use the Back and Forward buttons on the Eclipse
  toolbar that are shown below.</p>

  <p><img alt="Back forward buttons" src=
  "../../images/diagram_back_forward_buttons.png"> <a name=
  "arranging_figures" id="arranging_figures"></a></p>

  <div class="caution">
    <p>If you are making changes in a diagram and activate another
    diagram, or any other window in your Eclipse session, the model
    and diagram files will automatically be saved. This is done to
    avoid conflicts that can occur when changes are made in
    different diagram editors that refer to the same files.</p>

    <p>Note that undo spans file saving so that you can undo
    changes that were saved if you later decide you did not want to
    save them.</p>
