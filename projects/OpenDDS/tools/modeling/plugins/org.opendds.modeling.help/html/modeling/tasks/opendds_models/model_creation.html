  <h2>Creating a Model</h2>

  <p>To create an OpenDDS model, an Eclipse project must be
  identified to contain the model. An existing project of any type can be used, or a project can be created from menu <a href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard")'><b>Eclipse
  File -&gt; New</b></a> -&gt; Project... . A general project type can used
  as shown below.

  <p>Once a project has been selected a new OpenDDS model can be
  
  
  created from the <a href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard")'><b>Eclipse
  File -&gt; New</b></a> -&gt; Other... (Ctrl+N) menu item select
  OpenDDS Diagram under the OpenDDS Models category as shown in the
  figure below.</p><img alt="Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../../images/new_diagram_selection.png">

  <p>The Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard will prompt for the name of
  the model. This name is used in auto-generated source file names
  and is used as the name of the shared library. It is also used as
  the identifier for a C++ namespace.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>If you decide to later change the model name, click on an
    emtpy portion of the main diagram to bring up the name in the
    property sheet in the Properties tab below the diagram.</p>
  </div>

  <p>After selecting a model name the Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard
  will then prompt for the name of the diagram file and the name of
  the file containing domain model itself. It is recommended that
  when specifying these names that you use the default which is the
  name of the model itself.</p>

  <div class="caution">
    <p>Many diagram-based modeling tools keep both the model and
    diagram elements in a single file. In the case of the OpenDDS
    SDK these files are kept separate. Although this will enable
    alternative representations of the model to be considered, care
    should be taken that both the domain model file and diagram
    file are included when sharing OpenDDS models.</p>
