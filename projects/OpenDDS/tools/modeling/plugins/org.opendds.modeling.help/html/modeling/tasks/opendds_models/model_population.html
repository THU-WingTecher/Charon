  <h2>Populating the Model</h2>

  <p>After the selection of a new OpenDDS Diagram you will then be
  presented with an editor that consists of a canvas and a palette
  of "libraries" and a Package that can be dragged onto the canvas. An example of
  this editor is shown in the following figure.</p><img alt=
  "Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../../images/new_diagram_editor.png">

  <p>You can open a library that is on the canvas by first
  selecting it and then double-clicking on it or pressing the Enter
  key. You can verify it is selected when you see a thick border
  around the figure with re-sizing handles on it as shown
  below.</p><img alt="Selected library" src=
  "../../images/main_diagram_selected_lib.png">

  <p>When you open up a library there will be a new editor window
  in your editor window. See <a href=
  "../diagrams/moving_between_diagrams.html">Moving between
  Diagrams</a> for information on working with multiple diagram
  editors.</p>

  <p>The libraries can optionally be organized by Packages. See
  <a href="using_packages.html">Using Packages</a> for more information.
  </p>
   
   <div class="caution">
    <p>Although the <a href="../diagrams/modeling_perspective.html">OpenDDS Modeling perspective</a>
    includes a Properties view exposing the underlying model in the &quot;Core&quot; tab, effort has been
    made to minimize the need go between the diagram and Properties view. Care
    should be taken when making modifications in the Properties view
    since it may be possible to violate certain modeling assumptions that the
    diagram components are built on. </p>
