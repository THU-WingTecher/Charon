  <h2>Using Libraries from other Model Files</h2>

  <p>You can make it explicit that you will be using libraries from
  other OpenDDS model files by dragging those libraries from the
  Project Explorer view to the main diagram canvas. These shortcuts
  will have an arrow attached to them indicating they are aliases
  to elements in other files.</p>

  <p>For example, in the figure below, the ReliabilityPolicies
  library from the Policies.opendds file is shown as a shortcut on
  the main diagram. The policies from this library will then be
  available to select from when referencing shared
  policies.</p><img alt="Library shortcut on main diagram" src=

  <div class="note">
    <p>Multiple packages (e.g. the four "Model Policies" shown in
    the above figure) may be displayed. This is harmless and any
    one of the packages can be used.</p>
