  <h2>Adding Policies</h2>

  <p>For a policy you would like to define, select the policy type from the palette and add it to the
  canvas. Provide a name for the policy and edit the policy fields as appropriate.</p>

  <div class="note">
    The policy names are listed when selecting shared policies for domain elements in
    <a href="../dcps_lib/dcps_libs_defined.html">DcpsLib</a> diagrams, so make sure they
    are descriptive.
  </div>

  <p>Some policies have durations that default to infinite duration. In this case the duration
  will show "Infinity" for the second and nanosecond fields. (This corresponds to the DURATION_INFINITE_SEC
  and DURATION_INFINITE_NSEC constants in the DDS IDL module.)</p>
  
  <img src="../../images/policy_duration_infinite.png">
  
  <p>You can indicate that a second or nanosecond field is infinite by entering "Infinity" (or "inf" for short)
  when editing the field.</p>
