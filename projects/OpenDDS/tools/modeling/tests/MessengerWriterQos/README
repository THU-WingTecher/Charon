This is a clone of the Development Guide Messenger example.  It
demonstrates the creation and execution of an OpenDDS application using
model defined middleware and application code.

The following files are part of this example:
  Messenger.mpc          - MPC file to create the build files for the example.
  MessengerModel.opendds - XML file with the DCPS model definition.
  publisher.cpp          - Publisher application code.
  subscriber.cpp         - Subscriber application code.
  run_test.pl            - Perl script to execute the example.
  tcp.conf               - Service configuration directives to load the TCP
                           transport.

NOTE: The run_test.pl and tcp.conf files are simply copies of the
      original DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger example files.  The test
      application code in publisher.cpp and subscriber.cpp is largely
      copied directly from the original files as well, with
      simplifications to use the generated DCPS model.

----------------------------------------
Quick Start:
  shell> mwc.pl -type gnuace && make && mwc.pl -type gnuace && make && ./run_test.pl
  shell> make realclean && rm -f GNU* .depend* *.log

----------------------------------------
Build and Test:

1) Generate the build files:

  shell> mwc.pl -type gnuace

2) Generate the model source files:

  shell> make

3) Regenerate the build files (to include the generated model project):

  shell> mwc.pl -type gnuace

4) Build the model library and applications:

  shell> make

5) Execute the example:

  shell> ./run_test.pl

----------------------------------------
Clean up:

  shell> make realclean
  shell> rm -f GNU* .depend* *.log
