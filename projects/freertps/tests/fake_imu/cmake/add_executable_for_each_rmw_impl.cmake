# This file provides the add_executable_for_each_rmw_impl function.
# The function takes similar arguments as add_executable, but several executables.
# It creates one executable of the name you provide, which uses the default rmw implementation.
# It also creates a version of your executable for each rmw implementation specifically.
# These executables will be the name you gave plus a suffix like '__<impl_name>'.
# This makes it easier to test the examples across different middleware implementations.

# Get the rmw implementations which are available.
