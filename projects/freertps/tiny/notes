freertps low-bandwidth frame format
0: preamble = 0x42
1: frame format. various formats defined for best-effort vs. realiable, self-contained vs. fragmented, etc.
2: length. in format 0x1 (the most basic best-effort, self-contained frame format) this is just 1 byte
3: destination address (8-bit)
4: source address (8-bit)
5: destination endpoint (8-bit)
6: source endpoint (8-bit)
7-N: data payload
N+1: checksum low byte
N+2: checksum high byte
====
address 0xff is the broadcast address, and has a pre-defined endpoints for node discovery and address allocation

what should this be called? 
TRTPS:  tiny RTPS
LBRTPS: low-bandwidth RTPS
SRTPS:  small RTPS
CRTPS:  compact RTPS
c "namespace" (prefix) = frc = freertps "small"
then rename "normal" rtps to "fru" for "freertps UDP" but that conflicts with "freertps usb"

how about "fr" for "freertps" and then a 3-digit code for the transport:

rtps_ is the prefix for all user-facing calls

internal library prefixes:

rtps_udp = udp transport library prefix, implements nominal RTPS spec
rtps_usb = usb transport library prefix
rtps_ser = unframed-serial transport library prefix
rtps_compact = commonly-used stuff by rtps_usb and rtps_ser
